Hey everyone, Lawrence here. I'm a software engineer by trade, but there's much more than meets the eye. When I'm not writing code, you can find me doing one (or more) of a number of things, such as playing piano, working out, learning something new, or just thinking about things.

This blog will be a collection of posts on software engineering, music, productivity, philosophy, and whatever else is on my mind.
